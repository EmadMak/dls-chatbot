incidentals derived from the ship and its freight
earned.

purposes of its operation or navigation, on
the strength of an authorization from a majortty

shal1 include its hull completely and its tackle,
equipment, machines and other accessories, as
well as its wreckage, unless agreed otherwige.

tgage relates to a share only in a ship, the
creditor may request the attachment and sale
of that share only. However, if more than half
the ship is mortgaged to a creditor, he may after
attachment, request the sale of the ship com-
pletely provided that he shall invite the joint
owners to take part in such public sale.
If the sale by public auction results in the
award of the ship to one of the joint owners
or if after distribution among joint owners,
one of them acquires the ship as part of his
share, the mortgage shall remain unaltered after
such sale or distribution even if the joint
owner who so acquires the ship is not the joint
owner who mortgaged his joint share in the ship.
If the sale by public auction is carried out
by judicial order in accordance with the pro-
visions of section (85) and of the sections
immediately following that section in this law,
and results in the award being made to a pur-
chaser who is not a joint owner, the right of
the creditors to whom only a share in the ship
has been mortgaged shall be considered as a
Preferred right in that portion of the proceeds
of the sale which relate to the mortgaged right.
Likewise the costs chargeable against each share
in the ownership of the ship shall become automa-
tically chargeable against that portion of the
proceeds of sale which relates to that share.

SECTION 198 :
A contract for the chartering of a ship or for
the carriage of goods by sea must be confirmed
in writing. Such written document shall be re-
ferred to as
charterparty or as a bil1 of
lading depending on the type of carriage of the
goods by sea. The contracting parties shal1
not, however, be required to prepare a written
document In the case of coastal navigation.
SECTION 199: The hire of a ship shall be proved by a charter-
party, which shall be prepared in the form of a
signed private document in two coples.
A charterparty must contain the following parti-
culars : -
1. The names of the contracting partles.
2. The name, nationality and tonnage of the
ship, unless it 1s stipulated that the ship wi11
be designated subsequently.
3. The name of the master.
4. The types and quantities of the goods to be
shipped.
5. The freight (or fares)
6. The time and place agreed upon for loading
and off-1oading.

(68)
SECTION 200 :
SECTION 201 :
SECTION 202 :
The bil1 of lading 1s a document given by the
master for the goods shipped, and it is pre-
pared in three copies: one copy to be given to
the shipper, a second copy to the consignee and
a third copy to the master.
A bi11 of lading must contain the following
particulars :-
a. The names of the contracting parties, the
operator and the charterer.
b. Specifications of the type, weight, volume
and markings of the goods and the number of
packages .
c. The name, nationality and tonnage of the
ship.
d. The terms of carriage including the freight
and the ports of departure and destination.
e. Date on which the bill of lading is delivered.
£. The number of coples prepared by the master.
8. The signature of the master or owner of the
ship or his agent, and of the shipper.
Any copy of the b111 of lading which does not
contain the aforesald particulars may only serve
as inconclusive written evidence which may be
corroborated by oral testimony.
The markings and the number of packages, and
the quantity, type and weight of the foods shal1
be recorded in the bil1 of lading on the basis
of the written statements subnitted by the ship-
per before shipment.
The markings must be adequate for the .identifi-
cation of the goods, and shall be so affixed as

SECTION 203:
SECTION 204 :
(69)
to remain easily legible until the end of the
voyage .
The carrier may refuse to record the declara-
tion of the shipper in the b111 of 1ading 1f
he has good reason to doubt their correctness,
or 1f he 1o unable to verify thom by ordinary
means.
In such a case the garrier must state
the reasons for his refusal, whereupon the onus
of proving any shortage shall be on the shipper
or on the consignee.
The document which is given to the shipper upon
his request before loading his goods instead of
after such loading, shall be considered as a
1ega1 b111 of lading.
A b111 of lading which is given in accordance with
the form prescribed above shal1 constitute proof
of receipt of the goods as described therein by
the carrier, unless proof to the contrary is
submitted.
If the declaration of the shipper regarding the
markings or the numbers of packages of the quan-
tity, type or weight of the goods 1s incorrect,
he shall be responslble toward the carrier for
al1 damages which might artse from such decla-
ration, The carrier may not, however, rely on
such Incorrect declaration to relleve himself
from responsibility towards any party other than
the shipper.
The b111 of lading may be made to a designated
consignee of to order or to bearer. A bill of
lading made to a designated consignee 1s not
negotiable, and the master may not deliver the
800ds to any person other than the person named
in the bi11 of lading. A bi11 of lading made
to order is negotiable by endorsement, which
endorsement must be dated; and the master may
deliver the goods only to the bearer of the

( 70)
endorsed bill of lading, even if such endorse-
ment is blank.
A b111 of lading made to bearer is negotiable
by mere handing over of the bill of lading, and
the master must deliver the goods to any person
who presents it.
SECTION 205:
The copies of a bi1l of lading which is made
ta order or to bearer rust contaln the expression
"negotiable" or "not negotlable", as well as a
statement indicating the number of copies made,
and stipulating that the implementation of one
copy shall render the other copies void.
The carrier may not rely, as against the bearer
of a negotiable copy which has been duly endor-
sed, on the defences which may be used against
the shipper unless 1t is established that such .
bearer is acting as an agent of the shipper.
The endorser guarantees merely the existence of
the goods shipped and the validity of the con-
tract of affreightment. If any dispute arises
among the bearers of several copies of a single
negotiable bill of lading before delivery of
the 800ds by the master, the copy which bears
the earliest endorsement shal1 be given priority.
After delivery of the goods to the bearer of
one of the negotiable coples, priority cannot be
given to the bearer of any other copy even 1f
such copy bears an earlier date.
SECTION 206:' In case of discrepancy between a b111 of lading
bearing the signature of the shipper, and the
bills bearing the signature of the master, each
original copy may be used against the party which
signed 1t.

(71)
SECTION 207: /In case of discrepancy between a charterparty
and a b111 of lading, the conditions of the
charterparty shall prevall in so far as the
relations of the lessor with the charterer are
concerned. But In so far as the relations of
the charterer with the shipper are concerned,
the b111 of lading only shall be considered,
unless 1t contalns an express stipulation that
the provisions of the charterparty shal1 prevail.
SECTION 208:
A *Directe b111 of lading that is to say a b1l1
of lading that is issued by a prime carrler
whereby he undertakes to ship the goods to thelr
destination In several shipments, makes him Liable
until the end of the journey for all the obliga-
tions arising therefrom
In particular he shal1
be responsible for the acts of the successivo
carriers who take over the goods.
These carriers shall not be responsible except
for such damage, destruction, losses of delay
as nay occur during their particular part of the
voyage.
SECTION 209 : If the nature of the goods or the conditions of
their carriage are such as to make it necessary
to conclude spectal agreements, the terms agreed
upon relating to the rights and 11abilities of
the carrler shall be implemented, unless they
violate public order, and provided that a nego-
tlable b111 of lading 1s not delivered, and that
the agreement shall be in the form of a document
which contains the expression "not negotiable".
SECTION 210 :
Priority shall be given generally to written
over printed conditions. If a charterparty and
a b111 of lading are prepared together and a
confllct then occurs between written and printed
conditions, the provisions of the bill of lading
shall prevail over those of the charterparty.

rescue and salvage of the ship which it tows of
its cargo, unless it carries out extraordinary
operations which cannot be considered as acts
for the implementation of the towing contract.

SECTION 252:
SECTION 253 :
SECTION 254 :
SECTION 255:
(82)
A charge shall be due even if the ships which
are involved in the salvage and rescue opera-
tions are owned by the same shipowner.
The amount of the salvage and rescue charge shal1
be determined by agreement of the two parties,
failing which it shall be determined by the court..
This provision shall also apply to the proport-
tonate distribution of the charge among several
rescuers, or among the shipowner and the master
and crew of the rescuing ship.
If the nationality of the rescuing ship is fore-
ign, apportionment among its owner, master and
crow
shall be governed by the law of its
state.
The court may set aside or amend at the request
of one of the contracting parties, any salvage
or rescue agreement which was concluded while a
ship was in distress, and under the influence of
such distress, if it deems that the conditions
of suich agreement are not fair.
The court may in any case likewise set aside or.
amend any salvage or rescue agreement at the re-
quest of one of the two contracting parties if it
is established to the satisfaction of the court
that the consent of one of the parties is defec-
tive by reason of fraud or suppression of infor-
mation, or if the charge is excessive either way,
and not commensurate with the services rendered.
In detemmining the amount of the charge, the court
shall take the following into consideration, as
may be appropriate in the circumstances:-
a. In the first place: the success achieved;
the effect exerted by the rescuers and the
effectiveness of these efforts; the danger
to which the rescued ship and its passengers,
crew and cargo, as well as the rescuers and

SECTION 256 :
SECTION 257 :
(83)
rescuing ship were exposed; the time invo1-
ved; the expenses and damage incurred; the
risk of liability and other risks to which
the rescuers are exposed; the value of the
equipment used by the rescuers; and, when
necessary, the facilities which had been
provided by the rescuing ship and its pre-
paration to enable it to undertake the sal-
vage and rescue operations.
b. In the second place: the value of the things
which are lost.
The same provisions shall apply to the apport-
ionment of the charge referred to in the second
paragraph of section (253). The court may red-
uce or disallow completely the charge if it is
established that the salvage and rescue opera-
tlons were necessitated by a fault of the res-
cuers, or if the rescuers had committed any
thefts or had hidden any stolen goods, or had
committed any other fraudulent acts.
No charge shall be payable in respect of persons
rescued.
Rescuers of human beings who intervene in the
course of the same perils shall be entitled to
a fair share of the charge due for the salvage
and rescue of the ship and its cargo and inci-
dentals.
The right to claim the salvage and rescue charge
shall be lost by prescription after the lapse of
two years from the date on which the salvage and
rescue operations end.
The aforesaid period of prescription shall not
Tun if the salvaged or rescued ship is not held
in Jordanian waters.

(84)
Any master of a ship who sees a person in the sea
who is in danger of drowning and fails to give
that person such assistance as wil1 not expose
his ship and its cargo and crew and passengers
to serious danger, shall be liable to imprison-
ment for a period ranging from one month to two
years, and to a fine ranging from ten Dinars to
three hundred Dinars, or to eithor of these two
penalties.
CHAPTER 2
MARINE LOSSES (DAMAGE)
SECTION 258 :
Marine losses are every damage or loss that may
occur to the ship or its cargo, as wel1 as al1
exceptional or extraordinary expenses which may
be paid to ensure the safety of the adventure.
SECTION 259: In the absence of any special agreement among al1
the parties concerned, marine losses shall be
settled in accordance with the following provi-
sions:
SECTION60 ;
Marine losses are of two kinds: Particular aver-
age losses and general average losses.
SECTION 261 : Particular average losses are al1 marine losses
to which any of the conditions prescribed in the
fo1lowing sections do not apply. Such 1osses
shali be borne by the owner of the damaged things.
SECTION 262 :
General average losses are damage and 1oss of
property and extraordinary expenses resulting
from any destruction which is intentionally
carried out by the master for the common benefit
in order to preserve the adventure from peri1.
A beneficial result from such an act shall not
be a legal requirement, save in the cases refer-
red to in section 266.
Such 1osses
are:

(85)
1. Danage losses: These are losses which are
sustained by:
a. The cargo, as a result of jettison of
the goods, or their use as fuel in
order to make possible the completion
of the voyage, or their transfer to a
1ighter in order to lighten or float
the ship, or the carrying out of acts at
sea for the purpose of extinguishing a
fire.
b. The ship, as a result of the destruction
of its equipment and tackla, of the
stranding of the ship in order to save
its cargo, or letting go the sails OF
the turning on of steam when the ship
is stranded.
2 . Expenditure losses: These are extraordinary
expenses paid by the master for the safety
of the adventure such as the expenses of
floating, rescue or towing of a damaged
ship, and the expenses of anchoring or put-
ting into port which are necessitated by a
peril of the sea, and the expenses of crewts
wages and provisions which are incurred as
a result of an extraordinary occurence, and
the expenses paid in lieu of an expense which
would have been a general average Loss, pro-
vided that such expense does not exceed the
amount of the general average loss instead
of which it was incurred, and finally the
expenses of adjusting general average losses.
SECTION 263: Only damage, sacrifice and expenses arising direc-
tly from an act which is in the rature of a
Beneral average loss, may be accepted as part of
the general average losses.
SECTION 2641 The onus of proof that an expense or a sacrifice
should be accepted as a Beneral average 10ss
shall be on the party who demands its acceptance
as such.

SECTION 265:
SECTION 266 :
SECTION 2671
SECTION 268 :
(86)
A special agreement shall not be binding unless
it is accepted by all the parties concerned in
the adventure, otherwise general average losses
shall be sattled in accordance with the fules
of adjustment prescribed in the following sections
with due regard to the application of the provi-
sions of special agreements among the parties
concerned.
In order to carry out an adjustment of general
average the whole ship and its cargo or a part
of the cargo must have been saved, unless either
of them was sacrificed in order to preserva the
other.
If the common peril is the result of a spacial
defect in the ship or the goods, or if it is
result of the fault of the master or the shippers,
the damage and expenses which are in the nature
of general average losses shall give rise to an
adjustment among all the parties concerned, pro-
Vided that the parties who contributed shall have
a right to claim their contributions from the
parties on whom the liability for the special
defect or the fault rests, and the latter partias
may not in any case claim the inclusion of tha
damage and expenses which they sustain in the
general average losses.
However, an operator who is exempted from liabi-
11ty, by an express provision in the charterparty
or the b111 of lading, for the navigational faults
of the master, may claim a contribution from gene-
ral average provided that the common peril was
the result of a navigational fault of the master.
Goods in respect of which a bill of lacing was
not issued, or a receipt of taking delivery was
not signed by the master, shall not be considered
as general average losses if they are lost, but
they shall contribute to general average if they
are saved.

SECTION 269 :
SECTION 270 :
SECTION 27L8
SECTION 272 :
(87)
This provision shall also apply to goods in re-
spect of which a false declaration was made, un-
less the party concered establishes good faith.
Goods which are damaged or which are lost, and
the declared value of which is less than their
actual value, shall be considered as 1osses on
the basis of their declared value, but shall con-
tribute on the basis of their actual value.
Goods which are carried on deck in a manner con-
trary to common usage shall contribute to general
average if they are saved, but if they are lost
the owner may not apply for participation in a
general average adjustment unless he can prove
that he did hot agree to the shipment of his
goods in this manner, The provisions of this
section shall not apply to coastal navigation.
Ma1l, of any kind, the personal luggage and effects
of passengers and crew, the wages of the crew,
the ship's provisions, and, in general, anything
which may be carried without a bil1 of lading shal1
not contribute, but if they are lost their value
shall be recoverable by way of general average
adjustment.
Any party concerned may be discharged from the
obligation to contribute by abandoning the pro-
perties which are subject to an adjustment, before
taking delivery of any of them.
The general average adjustment shall be carried
out at the final port of destination of the cargo
which 18 found on the ship at the time of sacri-
fice or at the place of termination of the adven-
ture, in accordance with the law of that port,
and on the basis of the values of the gooas on
arrival, taking into consideration the condition
of salvaged things.
The adjustment consists of three parts:
1. Determination of the creditor group.

(61)
SECTION 1791 Tho ohartering of a ship wholly shall not tnoludo
the cabina and other places roserved for the master
an.s the members of the crew. Novertheless the

goods 1n these cabins and places without the consent
of the charterer.
If a shlp is chartered wholly or partly, the
master may not carry on the ship of on the
chartered part of the ship any other goods without
tho consent of the charterer. In case of any
oontravention 1n this regard, the frelght on such
goods which are wrongfully carrled shal1 become

as well.
SECTION 180: The owner (1essor) of a shlp shall be responalble
for any 10ss or demage to the goods while they

1008 expenses Incurred by and duo to the charterar

nf the shlp. Such price shall bo detorined on
the basis of the value of the goods at the port
of destination 1f the ship arrives at the port
safely, othorwise 1t shal1 be determined on the
basis of their actual selling price.
The owner (1essor) of a ship shall have the right
to retain the freight due on all the goods whose
value he 1s obl1ged to pay. If tho shippers aro
not paid the value of their goods which were used
for tho roquirements of tho ship, the 103s which
they sustaln as a result shall be distributed pro
rata on the value of these goods and of all the
goods which reach thair destlnation or which are
salvaged subsequent to the time of the occurence
which made 1t necessary to resort to the sale or
the pledging of tho goocs.

(68)
SECTION 182: If no person appears to take delivery of the goods
or if the consignee refuses to taka delivery thereof,
the master may request the judicial authorities to
sell the goods wholly or partly to the extent re-
quired to settle the amount of the freight due, and
to order the placing of the unsold goods in custody.
If the proceeds of the sales. are not sufficient to
settle the amount of the freight, the master shall
have the right to clalm the difference from the
shippers.
IITLE 2

loan of a sum of money against a pledge of the
ship or its cargo, and which stipulates that the
lender shall forfeit his right to recover the
1oan should the properties which are pledged
perish as a
result of an unavoidable occurence
at sea, and that the loan shall be repayable to
the lender with maritime interest, that is to
say agreed interest, even if the amount of such
interest exceeds the maximum legal rate, should
the properties which are pledged arrive safely.
A bottomry loan may only be contracted with the
master during the voyage for the purpose of pay-
ing the expenses of repairs or other requirements
of the ship or of the cargo.
The necessity for meeting the expenses which are
incurred for the benefit of the ship of its cargo
must be ascertained by the Aqaba magistrate in
Jordan, and, if abroad, by the person exercising
consular authority, if any, otherwise by the local
magistrate.

SECTION 288:
SECTION 289$
SECTION 290 :
(91)
The competent magistrate shal1 supervise the
proceedings for the procurement of the bottomry
loan by publ1o tender, and the conclusion of the

lowest amount of maritime interest. However,
permission may be given when necessary for con-
tracting a bottomry loan by voluntary negotiation.
A bottomry loan may be made against the pladge
of the ship, cargo and freight jointly of the
pledge of any of them separately.
If the expenses are for the benefit of the cargo,
the master may pledge the goods. If the expenses
are for the benefit of the ship, the master may
not borrow against a pledge of the goods unless
he has already procured the' full amount which
he can borrow against the pledge of the ship.
If the master complies with the provisions pres-
cribed in the foregoing sections he shall not be
held personally liable for the loan. The owner
of the ship which is pledged against a bottomry
loan shall be liable for such loan, subject to
his right of abandonment and his right to 1imit
his liability as prescribed in section 96.
The owner of the goods which are pledged against
a bottomry loan shall be liable for such loan,

the loan shall indicate the date, the amount of
the loan, the intorest stipulated, the properties
pledged, the names of the contracting parties,
the ship and fhe master, and the period of the
1oan.

The lender shall not contribute to particular
average losses relating to the pledged properties,
but in case of sinking he shal1 bear a share of
the expenses of salvaging the pledged propertlos
in proportion to the amount of the loan.
If general average losses occur the amount of
the loan shall not be added to the values which
contribute, and the apbortlonment among the ship,
and its freight and its cargo shall be effected
as if no bottomry loan is involved, but the lender
shall bear part of the loss of the owners of the
pledged properties in proportion to the amount
of the loan.
If several bottomry loans are procured against
the pledge of the same properties, the order of
Priority among such loans shall be on the basis
of the dates on which they were procured, the
later loan having priority over the earlier loan.
Any right to submit a court claim arising from
a bottomry loan shall be lost by prescription

CHAPTER 1
FORMAL REQUISITES OF THE CONTRACT
AND THE VALIDITY OF THE OBLIGATIONS
OF THE ASSURED
SECTION 296 :
Marine insurance is a contract whereby the in-
surer agrees in consideration for the payment of
a premium, to indemnify the assured against

SECTION 297 :
SECTION 298 :
(93)
damages sustained in the course of a marine ad~
venture as a result of an actual loss of value,
provided that the amount of such indemnity shall
not exceed the value of the subject matter which
was lost.
Al1 the provisions of this part which do not con-
tain an express stipulation to the effect that
they shall be applicable notwithstanding any
agreoment to the contrary, of to the effoct that
their violation shall render vold any contrary
agroement , shall only be regarded as interpreting
the w111 of the contracting parties and may be
superseded by express provision.
The insurence contract shall be made in writing
in two original copies.
It shall contaln the following particulars:-
a.
The date of the contract and whether it was
concluded in the forenoon or in the afternoon
of that date.
b. The name and place of residence of the person
who requested the insurance for his own acco-
unt of for the account of some other party.
c. The risks which the insurer undertakes to

SECTION
: 301
(94)
Each of the contracting parties shall be entitled
to receive a true copy of the original insurance
contract.
The insurers may not be summoned to appear
before a court other than the court of the place
at which the contract was signed; but if the con-.
tract was oigned by an agent, the assured may sub-
mit his clalm to the court of the place of resi-
dence of the insurer.
If the signature in respect of more than half
the value insured was effected at one place, the
assured may summon all the insurers to appear
before the court of that place, which court would
thus be seized of the case and may determine the
claim in their presence.
The non-disclosure of any information, or any
false representation made by the assured at the
time of concluding the contract, and any discre-
pancy between the insurance policy and the ship-
Ping documents which tends to diminish the 1dea
of the risk shall render the insurance void even
in the absence of any intent to defraud.
The insurance shall likewise be rendered void
even if the non-disclosure of information, or
the discrepancy or false representation does not
have any effect on the damage which occurs to,
or the loss of the subject-matter insured.
If there is an intent to defraud, the insurer shal1
be entitled to the full amount of the premium,
and if there is no such intent he shall be entit-
led to half the amount of the premium.
The assured must also inform the insurer of any
future events which will occur after the conclud-
ing of the contract and which might influence
the insurer in underwriting the risk, failing
which the insurance shall be rendered void.

SECTION 302:
SECTION 303:
SECTION 304:
SECTION 305:
(95)
The defences which would have been available to
the insurer under the insurance policy against
the original assured shall also be available to
him against any bearer to whom the policy may
be subsequently assigned even if such pol1cy is
made to order or to bearer.
The assured may always set aside the insurance
contract if the risks have not started to mun.
An assured who is unable to establish force
majeure shall pay to the insurer a fixed indem-
nity amounting to half the premium stipulated
in the contract.
If the subject-matter insured consists of goods
on the outward voyage and on the homeward voyage,
and if no goods are shipped on the homeward
voyage after the arrival of the ship at its ori-
g1nal destination or if the shipment for the
homeward voyage is not completed, the insurer
shal1 receive two thirds of the agreed premium
only, unless otherwise agreed.
If the assured becomes bankrupt or if notice is
published that he has stopped payment, or if he
fails to pay the premium which is due, the in-
surers, after serving a warning on the assured
at his place of residence calling on him to pay
or to give an acceptable guarantee within a per~
1od of 24 hours, and the failure of the assured
to comply with such warning, may abrogate any
insurance by a simple notice which may even be

The assured shall likewise have the same rights
against an insurer who becomes bankrupt, or in
respect of whom a notice to the effect that he
has stopped payment is published.
The provistons of the first paragraph shall not
apply to a bona fide holder in due course of the
bi11 of lading and the insurance policy or its
appendix.
The publ1c sale of the ship shall automatically
terminate the insurance on the date of such sale.
The insurance shall automatically continue 1f a
Private sale 1s effocted which involves less than
half the value insurod.
If a private sale involves half the value insured
at loast, the Insurance shall not continue unloss
the ingurers agree to its continuation.
The chartering of a ship shall not set aside the
insurance, unless otherwise agreed.
Notice of the accident or loss shall be given by
the assured to the insurers within a period of
three days from the time when the accident or
1oss comes to the knowledge of the assured.
He must mitigate the effect of the peril in so
far as possible and must adopt all precautionary
measures and supervise the salvage operations
of the subject-matter insured or carry out such
operatlons himself, and must protect the right
to submit any claim against the persons who are
responsible towards third partles.
The assured who carrles out salvage operations
shal1 not lose his rights of indemnification and
abandonment. He shall be entitled to recover
his expenses
on the basis of his own statement,
subject to the right of the insurer to prove
fraud.

SECTION 310 :
SECTION 311 :
(97)
The insurer himself may likewise carry out al1
the precautionary or salvage measures, and no
party may object thereto on the ground that this
constitutes a proprietary act.
The consignee must request the representatives
or agents of the insurers who are specified in
the pollcy, 1f any, otherwise the local competent
authority, in order to carry out a survey of the
marine loss or damage, failing which the court
case may be rejected.
The consignees must furthermore complete such
surveys within a period of eight days after the
day on which the carrier places the goods at their
disposal or at the disposal of their representa-
tives or agents, provided that such period shal1
not exceed thirty days as from the date on which
the goods arrive at their destination, failing
which the court case may be rejected.
The aforesaid period of thirty days shall not,
however, apply to a consignee who proves that he
was not aware of the arrival of the goods at
their destination.
If insurance contracts are confirmed by documents
which are not formal policies, that is to say by
participation agreements, the assured must declare
the period during which such a document remains
in force in respect of all shipments which are
made for his own account and those which are made
for the account of other persons whose goods he
is insuring on their behalf, to the extent to
which these shipments are covered by insurance.
If the assured fails to carry out this obligation,
the contract may be terminated at the request of
the insurer, who may, in any case, retain tha
Premiums, and who shall furthermore be entitled
to receive payment of the premiums relating to
the shipments which have not been declared.

If the declaration relates to goods which are
insured for the account of a third party, it
shall have no effect if it is made after the
occurence of the casualty.

for the benefit of the person who signs it, and
as an agreement concluded by the beneficiary on
behalf of a third party who is known at the time,
or who wi11 become known subsequently.
The person who signs a policy relating to insura-
nce concluded for the benefit of an unspecified
person, shall be personally liable for the pay-

THE SUBJECT MATTER INSURED
Every person having an interest therein, may in-
sure a ship and its goar, or a ship under con-
struction and the parts to be used in its cons~
truction which are found in the factory, the
cost of equipment and provisions, seamen's wages,
freight, the amounts of maritime loans, goods,
currenoy and financial documents carried on the
ship, expected profits, and, in general, all
things which have a monetary value and
which may
be exposed to navigational perils.
The acceptable value ‹
of the ship shall include
all its incidentals whatsoever, particularly pro-
visions, advances glven to the members of the
crew, equipment and all expenses unless it can
be proved that such expenses are related to an
interest that is not related to the ownerghip of
the ship.

SECTION 316 :
SECTION 317:
SECTION 318 :
SECTION 319 :
( 99)
If the subject matter insured is the net freight,
the amount of such freight shall be assessed at
sixty percent of the gross freight where no amount
is specified in the insurance contract.
The expectod profit, shall be assessed at one tenth
of the value at the place of the voyage unless
the insurers expressly agree to a higher assess-
ment, in which case such higher assessment shal1
be specified in the policy.
If the value of the foods is not specified in
the contract, it may be established by means of
involces and account books, otherwise the value
of the goods shall be assessed on the basis of
the prevailing price at the time and place of
shipment, to which shal1 be added all charges and
expenses paid until the transfer of the goods
on board, and freight earned in any event, and
the insurance premium, and the expected profit
when necessary.
The same applies to the assessment of the value
of tho hul1 of the shlp and its tackle, fittings
ana equlpment, which should be determined on the
basis of their values on the day on which the
risk starts to run.
Al1 supplles and provisions and other things
which have a monetary value shall be assessed
on the basis of their values at the time and
place at which the risks start to ruun.
The insurer may prove at any time that the accep-
ted value exceeds the real value of the subject
matter insured, even if he has accepted the valu-
ation made by the assured in the policy.
The insurer may re-insure with another insurer,
the risks against which he has insured. Such
re-insurance shall be subject to the provisions
of this part, and the first ingurer alone shal1
remain liable towards the assured.

SECTION 320: The insurer may insure the premium.
SECTION 321:
Any Insurance contract which is concluded after
the loss or the arrival of the subject matter
insured shall be void if it ts established that
notice of the loss or the arrival of the goods
was given at the place where the assured is found,
before he ordered the insurance to be concluded,
or at the place where the contract was signed,
before the insurer signed it.
If the subject matter insured is the safety of
the adventure (and this shall be permissible only
for the insurance of an equipped ship) the con-
tract may not be set aside unless it is proved
that the assured was aware of the destruction of
the ship, or that the insurer was aware of its
arrival, before signing the contract.
If such proof is established against the assured
he shall pay the promiun two-fold to the insurer;
and if
such proof is established agalnst the in-
surer he shall pay to the assured an amount equal
to double the amount of the agreed premium.
SECTION 322: The insurance which is concluded by an agent shal1
be void if it was possible for such agent to
become aware of the news.
The insurance shall also be void if the princ1-
pal was aware of the news. If the principal
becomes aware of the news after 1ssuing his in-
structions, he must immediatoly revoke such in-
structions, by telegraphic means when necessary;
but the insurance shall take effect if the cont-
ract is signed before receipt of such revocation
of instructions.
SECTION 323 :
If the master is permitted to ship goods for his
own account on the ship of which he is master,
.and 1f he desires to insure such goods he must
prove to the insurers by any means that he has
purchased the goods, and must submit a bill of
lading 1n
respect thereof signed by two senior
members of the crew.

( 101)
SECTION 324:
In the absence of a bill of lading, or where the
bi11 of lading issued by the master contains cer-
tain provisions which detract from its value as
evidence, the assured must submit other documents
to prove shipment, such as purchase invoices,
cargo manifests, copies of customs documents,
transport statements and correspondence . In the
absence of any other evidence, personal testimony
shall be admissible.
SECTION 325:
Marine insurance must be a contract of indemnity,
notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,
and it should not place the assured, after the
occurence of the casualties insured against, 1n
a better financial position than that in which
ho would have been, had such casualities not.
occured.
SECTION 3261 A person may conclude as many insurance contracts
as he may desire on the same subject matter, pro-
vided that he shall not derive any benefit from
these several contracts in excess of the losses
which he has sustained.
SECTION 327: If the amount of the insurance exceeds the value
of the subject matter, and if it is establishee
that the assured has practiced deceit or fraud,
the contract shall be voidable at the option of
the insurer, and he shall be entitled to receive
the full amount of tho premium as compensation.
In the absence of deceit or fraud the contract
shall be val1d to the extent of the value of the
subjevt matter as assessed or as agreed upon.
The insurer shall not be entitled to a premium
on the excess value, but he shall have a right
to damages when necessary.
SECTION 3281
If the total amount of insurance under several
contracts excoeds the value of the subject matter,
the contracts
shall be voidable in accordance with
the provisions of the last preceeding section in
case of deceit or fraud on the part of the assured.

SECTION 329:
SECTION 330 :
SECTION 331 :
(102)
In the absence of such deceit or fraud the cont-
racts shall be valid to the extent of the ratio
of the amount of the insurance to the full value
of the subject matter, This tule, however, may
be superseded by a provision in the policy to
the effect. that the date order basis shall be
adopted or that the insurers assume liability
jo1ntly.
If the insurance contract covers only a part of
the value of the subject matter, the assured shall
be deemed to have underwritten the remaining part
himself; accordingly he shall bear a proportionate
amount of the loss, unless it is expressly pro-
vided that the assured shall be entitled to be
indemnified in full within the limits of the
amount of the insurance if the loss does not
exceed the amount insured.
CHAPTER 3
PERILS INSURED AGAINSI AND
PERILS EXCLUDED
Insurance shall be considered as marine in-
surance if the subject matter is a vessel which
can be described as a ship even if such vessel
is not engaged in marine navigation.

repair or construction in a shipyard or dry-dock,
and in general in any place whatsoever within "

and of towing a ship to a port for repairs.
The provision of this section shall not apply
to stranding which is the result of the natural
ebb and flow of the tide, nor to stranding which
occurs in sea canals or rivers or streams at
points which are beyond the places reached by
the ebb and flow of the tide.
If the expenses of temporary stoppago are part
of particular average losses, the insurer shall
not be liable for the provisions and the wages
of the crew.
If, however, the ship is taken to a more suitable
port than the port at which it was temporarily
anchored, in ordor to carry out repairs at the
expense of the insurers, they shall be liable
for the provisions and the wages of the crew and
for the expenses of towage.

(104)
The same shall apply to a ship which is tempora-
rily anchored at a port awaiting the arrival of
spare parts which are required to enable it to

other ship owned by the assured, settlement shall
be effected as if the ships belonged to, two dif-
ferent operators. Claims relating to responsi-
bility towards the parties having an interest in
the hull of the ship for collision and for ser-
vices rendered shal1 be determined by a single
arbitrator who shall be appointed by agreement
among the assured, failing which the arbitrator
shall be appointed by a decision to be 1ssued
as sonn as possiblo by the President of the
Court of First Instance within whose area of
jurisdiction the Port lies.
These provisions shall also apply to a colllsion
between a ship and a fixed or floating body be-
longing to the assured.

SECTION 341:
SECTION 342:
SECTION 343:
(105)
As an exception to and notwithstanding the fore-
going provisions reiating to insurance against
damage caused by barratry, the insurers shal1
not be held liable for: -

master or the crew on land, which effect the
ship.
The insurer shall not be liable for loss or dam-
age arising from an inharent vice in the subject
matter insured, unless agreed otherwise, of un-
less the subject matter insured is the hull of
the ship and tho loss or damage is the resuli

not have foreseen or prevented.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the last pre-
ceoding section, the insurer shall be liable for
such 1oss and such damage if the voyage is extra-
ordinarily delayed as a result of an occurence
which is insured against, provided that the loss
or damage is causad by the delay..
The insurer shall not be llable for the damage
caused by the subject matter insured to other
things or persons, unless otherwise stipulated.
The liabillty of the insurers for claims submit-
ted by third parties against the ship arising from
its collision with another ship or with a float-
ing vessel or from striking against breakwaters,
wharves, docks or other fixed structures shal1
amount to nine tenths of the damages awarded,
up to a maximun of nine tenths of the value in-
sured.

SECTION 344:
SECTION 345 :
(106)
The assured shall bear one tenth of the damage,
and he may not insure against this one tenth.
Any violation of this shall render the assured
11able for an additional one tenth.
No claim may be submitted against the insurers
by any person for any reason whatsoever for
damages or 10s8 relating to the loading of the

If a destroyed/was owned or partly owned by the
master, payment of his share of the indemnity
shall be withheld until the submission of the
certificate indicating the result of the inquiry,
which must be carried out, regarding his conduct.
If it is established by such inquiry that the
1oss was due to the fault of the master, even
in the absence of any deceit or fraud on his part,
the insurers may be discharged from their obliga-
tion to pay indemnity in respect of the share
of the master 1f they pay him by way of settle-
ment fifty per cent of the amount of sach indem-
nity.
If the subject matter insured is the hull of the
ship, and the duratlon of the risks 1s not spci-
fied in the contract, then the risks insured
against under a voyage pollcy shall start to run
as from the time of salling or weighing anchor
of the ship, and shall terminate when the ship
1g moored at anchor at the port of destination.
If, however, the ship carries a cargo of goods,
the risks shall start to run as from the time when
loading
the goods commences, and shall termi-
nate when offloading is completed, provided that
the duration shall not extend beyond fifteen days
after the arrival of the ship at the port of dest-
ination unless goods for another vgyage are loaded
at
the port of destination before the lapse of
the aforesaid period of fifteen days, in which
case the risks insured against shall terminate
forthwith.

SECTION 346:
SECTION 347 :
( 107)
The perioc spent in quarantine shall be considered
as a part of the voyage in the course of which
the ship is put in quarantine.
If, however, a ship which has been insured for
a voyage is put in quarantine at a place other
than the port of destination, the insurer shall
be entitled to an additional premium of three
quarters of one per cent monthly as from the date
of sailing to the place where the ship 1s to be
put in quarantine until the date of 1ts returt.
The same rate of additional premium shall be duo
to the insurers if the ship has to stay outside
the port of destination or proceed to another
port because the port of destination is blockaded.
In such a case the insurers liability for the
risks shall extend to the full period of waiting
oI of sailing to another port, as the case may
be, provided that such extended period shall not
exceed six months from the date of arrival out-
side the blockaded port. The insurers, however,
shal1 not be llable for any costs or any increase
in expenditures as a result of such waiting or
sailing to another port.
The assured may terminate the risks before the
lapse of s1x months, 1f he so desires.
In the case of an "entire" premium for insurance
against risks on the outward as well as on the
homeward voyage, a period of waiting of four months
shall be allowed without an inerease in premium
as from thiglnag of arrival of the ship at its
port of /departure. If the period of waiting ex-
ceeds four months the insurers shall be entitled
to an increase of two thirds of one per cent for
every additional month.
If the insurance is "from under ships tackle to
under ships tackle" and if the perioa of the Fisks
is not specified in the contract, the risks shall
start to run as from the time when the goods leave
the land in order to be loaded, and shall terminate

( 108)

the port of destination. The risks of direct
transportation by boats from the land to the ship,
and from the ship to the land shall be borne by
the insurers.
SECTION 348 :
If any change in the voyage 1s intentionally made
after the departure of the ship, the insurer shall
have the right to compensation and he shall not

be void and the insurer shall be entitled to re-
ceive half the premiun specified in the contract
as fixed compensation.
SECTION 349 :
SECTION 350 :
SECTION 351:
SECTION 352:
If the ship goes astray the risks encountered while
it was on its correct course shall be insured,
provided that the insurer shall have the right to
prove that such risks were the result of the ship
g0ing astray.
A change of the ship shall render void an insu-
rance contract the subject matter of which is
the hull of the ship. Likewise an insurance con-
tract the subject matter of which is the ship
and its equipment shal1 be rendered void 1f the
ship 1s changed, unless agreed otherwise.
If the insured goods are shipped on deck, the
insurers shall not be liable for the risks unless
such carriage on deck is permissible 1n accordance
with established navigation practice and if no
contrary agreement has been concluded.
CHAPTER 4
DETERMINATION AND SETTLEMENT OF

assured in accordance wita the following rules.
If tha 10ss of the ship is a total 10ss, then
in so far as the particular losses of the ship
are concerned, the damage shall be determined on
the basis of the value of the ship. In the case
of expanditure losses, the amount of damages shal1
be determined on the basis of the amount he pays
to the assured after deducting the share due to
him for the accident which causad the expenses,
when necessary.
In the determination of a marine 1oss, the costs
which are actually paid for replacements and re-
pairs, as established by statements of account ,
and which are accepted by the experts as being
necessary for preparing the ship for navigation
shall only be taken into consideration, and the
assured may not claim any additional indemnity
for loss of value or for the period of idleness
Or for any other reason, whether by way of part-
icular or general average 1oss.
The insurers may demand that the replacements and
repairs be carried out on the basis of publ1c
tender, or written offers. If the assured does
not comply, an amcunt squal to 25 per cent of
tho total costs cf replacements and repairs shall
be decucted.
The insurers shal1 be responsible for the pro-

experts are of the opinion that such expenditure
can be postponed to a more suitable time.
The master must furtherore consult the represen-
tative of the insurer, 1f any, otherwise the
Jordanian consul, before carrying out any repairs
at a port of temporary call. If such repairs
cannot bo carried out, or if their cost is exces-
sive, he may only carry out such repairs as can-
not be de ferred.
The insurers may direct the ship to be taken to
a port which is better equiped to carry out the
repairs at less cost, and the shif shall be towea
to such port, when necessary.
The value of the wreckage of the ship shall be
deducted from the amount of the indemnity and
the indemnity shall be subject to a deduction of
the increased value arrising from the renewal,
The amount of this deduction shall be determined
in accordance with a special clause to be included
in the insurance policy.
The marine losses on cargo shall be determined
on a proportionate gross basis in relation to
the amount pald, that is to say:-

the value they would have fetched at the
port of destination had they arrived safely,
and applying the resulting reduction in
value to their insured value,

in. the subject matter insured to the insurance
company .
An insured ship may only be abandoned in the fo1-
lowing cases: Absence of any news, disappearance,
total loss, unseaworthiness resulting from an
unavoidable marine accident, provided that an
insured risk is involved in the matter; and in
the case of insurance against war risks, arrest
or detainment of the ship by order of the Autho-
rities.
Absence of any news regarding steamships of any
type whatsoever for a period of four months shall
give a right to abandon such ships. Absence of
news of any sailing ships other than those which
sail around Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope
for a period of six months shall give a right
to abandon such ships. Absence of news of sail-
ing ships which sail around Cape Horn and the
Cape of Good Hope for a period of eight months
shal1 give a right to abandon such ships. The
aforesald periods shall start to run as from the
last date on which news was received.
If the last news was sent while the risks under
a time insurance contract were sti11 running, it
shall be assumed that the 10ss of the ship occurea
during the period covered by the insurance cont-
ract.
The ship shall be deemed unseaworthy if the total
cost of its repairs which are necessitated by a
marine casualty exceeds three quarters of its
accepted value.
SECTION 370 : A ship which is compelled to stop because of the
absence of the physical means required for its
repair shall also be deemed unseaworthy and may
be abandoned to the insurers, provided that it
is established that the ship 1s unable to proceee
safely even after lightening its 1oad, or even

if it is towed to another port where such means
of repair are availablej but the operators must
prove that they were unable to bring the neces-
sary spare parts to the port at which the ship
was anchored › otherwise the ship cannot be consi-
dered unseaworthy; and 1t may not be abandoned
to the insurers if it is comfelled to stop due
to the lack of the necessary funds to meet the
cost of repairs and other expenses.
Insured goods may only be abandoned in the fol~
lowing cases and provided that an insured Fisk
is involved in each case:
1. Absence of any news for the period prescribed
in section 367.
2. Unseaworthiness of the ship as a result of
a marine accident, and the impossibility of
transporting the goods within the periods
specified below, or at least where the ship-
ment of the goods on another ship has not
commenced within these periods: - four months
1f the accident occurs along the coasts of
furope or its islands, or along the Medite-
rranean coasts of Asia and Africa, of along
the Black Sea Coast of Asta, or along the
Atlantic coasts and its islands outside
Europe, and s1x months if the accident occurs
along any other coasts or islands.
